  "	I'll never give you away 'Cause I've already made that mistake If my name never fell off your lips again I know it'd be such a shame When I take a look at my life And all of my crimes You're the only thing that I think I got I right I'll never give you away 'Cause I've already made Already made that mistake",
  "	We'll make a palace of this apartment The best thing of all is only just started and I know When you're home, I'm home Stars through the window, they light up our disco It's just you and I, the two of us starring in this show We'll never be alone 'Cause when you're home, I'm home",
  "	You and I are so entwined, I always knew that I was made for you,",
  "	The house that you live in don't make it a home But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone People in life, they will come and they'll leave But if I had a choice I know where I would be Through the lows and the highs, I will stay by your side There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say At the end of the day, I choose you.",
  "	I'll practice my patience While you're getting wasted 'Til fate brings you home I'll wait through your phases You'll shuffle through faces Like songs in your playlist 'Til fate brings you home I'll wait through your phases (Phases)",
  "	I love you more than the bad days ahead I love you more than the nights that we ended with slammin' doors Ooh, I love you more There will be times when your heart will forget So I'll say it over and over again So you know for sure Darlin' I love you",
  " Oh, I'm into you And girl, no one else would do 'Cause with every kiss and every hug You make me fall in love And now I know I can't be the only one I bet there's hearts all over the world tonight With the love of their life who feels What I feel when I'm With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, girl With you, with you, with you, with you, with you",
  " I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth But if I do, it's you Oh, it's you, they add up to I'm in love with you And all these little things",
  "	'Til I wake up in the morning, you're all that I see You run through my head, in and out of my dreams Breathe for a minute, try and focus on me But I can't think of anyone else Now my heart is broken and I'm crying on the floor And every part of me hopes you walk through the door But you're not here, baby, and I can't love anyone else 'Til I forgive myself",
  "	But baby there you go again, there you go again making me love you (Making me you love you) Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head Let it all go (let it all go) Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah) And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you (ah) So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (yeah) That I'll only stay with you one more night (oh-oh-oh) And I know, I've said it a million times (yeah) But I'll only stay with you one more night (yeah)",
  " Right before I close my eyes The only thing that's on my mind Been dreamin' that you feel it too I wonder what it's like to be loved by you Yeah I wonder what it's like I wonder what it's like to be loved by",
  " It's raining, it's pouring My eyes, oh, they're stormy And I don't wanna leave this bed It's raining, it's pouring It's four in the morning And I don't wanna cry But I need you here 'cause I'm a mess",
  " She used to meet me on the Eastside In the city where the sun don't set And every day you know that we ride Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight We can go anywhere we want Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat Just take my hand and come with me, yeah",
  "	In my dreams you're with me We'll be everything I want us to be And from there, who knows? Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time Or is that just me and my imagination?",
  "	Let me love the lonely out of you Let me love the pain you're going through I think I'll save myself by saving you Let me love the lonely out of you",
  "	I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, If you let me, I'll be Out of my dress and into your arms tonight Yeah, I'm lost without it Feels like I'm always waitin' I need you to come get me Out of my head, and into your arms tonight, tonight",
  "	Sorry, I didn't respond for a week I was in class, and then I fell asleep Woke up late for work, and left my phone at home I didn't mean to leave you hanging there all alone",
  " You cut out a piece of me, and now I bleed internally Left here without you (no, no, no), without you (ooh) And it hurts for me to think about what life could possibly be like Without you (no, no, no), without you (no, no)",
  "	Little do you know I know you're hurt while I'm sound asleep Little do you know All my mistakes are slowly drownin' me Little do you know I'm tryin' to make it better piece by piece Little do you know I I love you 'til the sun dies",
  "	Hold on, I still want you Come back, I still need you Let me take your hand, I'll make it right I swear to love you all my life Hold on, I still need you",
  " Fire on fire would normally kill us But this much desire, together, we're winners They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms 'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me And look in my eyes You are perfection, my only direction It's fire on fire, mmm It's fire on fire",
  "	Now the day bleeds Into nightfall And you're not here To get me through it all I let my guard down And then you pulled the rug I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved",
  " We'll do it all Everything On our own We don't need Anything Or anyone If I lay here If I just lay here Would you lie with me and just forget the world?",
  "	Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday Couples holding hands on a runway They're all posing in a picture frame Whilst my world's crashing down Solo shadow on a sidewalk Just want somebody to die for Sunshine livin' on a perfect day While my world's crashing down I just want somebody to die for",
  "	I'm in too deep Can't touch the bottom with my feet Don't know what you did to me, I can't breathe but I'm living I'm in too deep Can't touch the bottom with my feet Don't know what you did to me, I can't breathe but I'm living",
  "	Because When the sun shines, we'll shine together Told you I'll be here forever Said I'll always be your friend Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end Now that it's raining more than ever Know that we'll still have each other You can stand under my umbrella You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh",
  " Yeah, don't talk down to me That's not gonna work now Packed all my clothes and I moved out I don't even wanna go to your house Everytime I sit on that couch I feel like you lecture me Eventually, I bet that we could have made this work And probably woulda figured things out But I guess I'm a letdown But it's cool, I checked out Oh, you wanna be friends now? Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now Sit around and talk about the good times That didn't even happen I mean, why are you laughing? Must have missed that joke let me see if I can find a reaction No, but at least you're happy Feels like we're on the edge right now I wish that I could say I'm proud I'm sorry that I let you down Oh, I let you down",
  " Oh don't you dare look back Just keep your eyes on me I said you're holding back She said shut up and dance with me This woman is my destiny She said oh oh oh Shut up and dance with me",
  "	Put your hand in mine You know that I want to be with you all the time You know that I won't stop until I make you mine You know that I won't stop until I make you mine Until I make you mine",
  "	And when the daylight comes I'll have to go But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close 'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own But tonight I need to hold you so close",
  "	I got, I got, I got, I got options You the, you the, you the, you the top one So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem Can I get some of your love? I got, I got, I got, I got options You the, you the, you the, you the top one So baby, baby, if it ain't a problem Can I get some of your love?",
  "	It's you It's always you Met a lot of people But nobody feels like you So please don't break my heart Don't tear me apart I know how it starts Trust me I've been broken before",
  "	I had all and then most of you Some and now none of you Take me back to the night we met I don't know what I'm supposed to do Haunted by the ghost of you Oh, take me back to the night we met",
  "	'Cause all of me loves all of you Love your curves and all your edges All your perfect imperfections Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you You're my end and my beginnin' Even when I lose, I'm winnin' 'Cause I give you all of me And you give me all of you, oh-oh",
  "	You don't understand how much you really mean to me I need you in my life, you're my necessity, yeah But believe me, you're everything that just makes my world complete My love is clear, the only thing that I'll ever see You're all I ever need Baby, you're amazing You're my angel, come and save me",
  "	Here comes the sun do, do, do Here comes the sun And I say it's all right",
  "	Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed I'll make a cup of coffee for your head It'll get you up and going out of bed",
  "	You gave me a shoulder when I needed it You showed me love when I wasn't feeling it You helped me fight when I was giving in And you made me laugh when I was losing it 'Cause you are, you are The reason why I'm still hanging on 'Cause you are, you are The reason why my head is still above water And if I could, I'd get you the moon And give it to you And if death was coming for you I'd give my life for you",
